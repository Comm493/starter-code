# starter-code
This is a version of the IBM-issued Flask boilerplate code which was once available from the Python Flask Cloud Foundry App creator on bluemix.net. This code is needed for the Starting with Bluemix Command Line Handout.

Update (2018-01-14): There was an issue with the posted manifest.yml file which is needed to initialize the application. It is now corrected. Please input the name of your application (what you named your application on bluemix.net, for example, Hello World) and your host (what proceeded the bluemix.net link, for example, hello-world-99.bluemix.net). You may choose to keep your hostname as your application name, for simplicity.
